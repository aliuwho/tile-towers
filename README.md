# Tile Towers
A custom variation of the game Tile Towers from the popular game Webkinz.

This game was made primarily for my roommate to play Tile Towers as many times as she wants :-)

## About The Game
Tile Towers is a variation of Mahjong and follows the same rules. You can match tiles which are considered "free" 
(that is to say, they are not completely surrounded by other tiles). When a level is cleared, the player can proceed to 
a new level with different tiles.

Unlike Mahjong, each level of Tile Towers is the same shape. In addition, a game of Tile Towers consists of 12 minutes 
where the player attempts to clear as many levels as they can.

It is important to note that Tile Towers is mainly luck. The tiles will be randomly distributed, and therefore not
every level can be solved. In the event that no moves remain, the board will auto-shuffle 1 time.

## Custom Additions
(tbd) Easy Mode: Unavailable tiles are greyed out, making it easier for the player to compare matches. 1 shuffle per game.

Normal Mode: All tiles look the same. 1 shuffle per game.

(tbd) Hard Mode: No shuffles. If you run out of moves, you move onto the next level.
